##Introduction


Hello IGN,
My name is Juan and I am extremely interested in the IGN code foo program and I believe I have the skills and work ethic to both learn from and contribute to the IGN team.

I had first heard of IGN about 10 years ago when I was seeking information on which video game I should get for christmas. It was during this time that I had stumbled upon a video review for ‘Gears of War’ by Jonathan Miller. It was because of this review, that I was introduced to my favorite game series of all time and ever since I have always considered IGN as the most reliable entertainment news media site whenever I am seeking information on a new game I am interested in or if I am simply curious about the current events in the gaming industry. I have had so many great gaming experiences and am realizing just now how many of those experiences intersect with IGN, whether it be spending hours upon hours on the Witcher 3 ign wiki so that I could collect my entire set of mastercrafted griffin armor or wait patiently to see which game won the IGN game of the year award.

Since learning about the code foo program, the thought that I might have the opportunity to make an impact on the platform that I have used for over half of my life is one that excites me. As a computer science graduate, being able to work with IGN would mean that I’d get to be a part of something that encapsulates the two things I am most passionate about: gaming and technology. Thank you IGN for taking the time to read this and providing your readers the opportunity to work with the platform we all love.
